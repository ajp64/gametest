# Development log
A document to make notes and reflections about the development of my game

### 24/12/2021
 - Investigated means to create a game using JS. Discovered Kaboom.js and replit, a JS library and browser based IDE that work together to make 
    the process of game creation more simple.
 - Watched parts of a tutorial on how to use Kaboom to create clones of Space Invaders, Super Mario and Zela. Useful but noted that the video is outdated,
   and the syntax for using Kaboom has changed
   
### 26/12/2021
 - Experimented with Kaboom.js and replit. Made some simple sprites and created a map, added some movement functionality for moving a player around.
