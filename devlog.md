# Development log
A document to make notes and reflections about the development of my game

### 24/12/2021
 - Investigated means to create a game using JS. Discovered Kaboom.js and replit, a JS library and browser based IDE that work together to make 
    the process of game creation more simple.
 - Watched parts of a tutorial on how to use Kaboom to create clones of Space Invaders, Super Mario and Zela. Useful but noted that the video is outdated,
   and the syntax for using Kaboom has changed
   
### 26/12/2021
 - Experimented with Kaboom.js and replit. Made some simple sprites and created a map, added some movement functionality for moving a player around.

### 29/12/2021

 - Created a basic map with walls and player sprite. Player has movement that changes based on direction, walls and player are solid so can't move through each other. 

 - created the structure of the first map.

 - tried to get text to appear when player is in proximity to an object in the game. Can only get text to appear, cannot seem to find functionality for checking constant proximity. 

 ### 30/12/2021

 - Worked on trying to get text appear when player is near object. after trying several methods including using collision, I found I could access the property for the players x and y position, and use this to check if they were near the console object. By changing the movement speed of the character, I could get them to stop when they press a key by the console, and return to normal gameplay by pressing another key to get out. Note: one particular issue I am having is that the docs appear to have some mistakes.

  ### 31/12/2021
  - added a character text input once the player accesses the console.
