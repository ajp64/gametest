# Planning and creating a game using JS

## Concept

As a project over the xmas/NY break from School of Code, I will make a game writted in JavaScript, running in a browser using an HTML canvas. Ideally, this game will be a simple adventure game, where the player controls a characters who can move through several screens and solve puzzles related to coding.

## Tools

After some initial research, using Kaboom.js as a library and Replit as an IDE looks like the simplest approach. Kaboom.js is a library with multiple built in methods and functions for creating a game, and Replit has built in tools for assisting (such as a sprite creator) so I will try using this to start.
